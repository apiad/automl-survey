name: Auto-Keras
description: Auto-Keras focuses on neural architecture search, using bayesian optimization with a custom acquistion function based on network morphism. Presents a high-level API inspired by `scikit-learn`, where users only need to select a task-specific model; and a low-level API where users can completely customize a neural search space.
