# AutoML Survey

> An (in-progress) AutoML survey focusing on practical systems.

---

This project is a community effort in constructing and maintaining an up-to-date beginner-friendly introduction to AutoML, focusing on practical systems.
AutoML is a big field, and continues to grow daily.
Hence, we cannot hope to provide a comprehensive description of every single approach available.

We are building a database of qualitative criteria for all AutoML systems we've heard of.

We define an AutoML system as a software project that can be used by non-experts in machine learning to build effective ML pipelines on at least some common domains and tasks.
It doesn't matter if its open-source and/or commercial, a library or an application with a GUI, or a cloud service.
What matters is that it is a usable software as opposed to, say, a reference implementation of a search strategy in a Jupyter Notebook.
