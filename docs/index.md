# Introduction to AutoML

*Automated Machine Learning*, or AutoML for short, is a novel and expanding field in the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and software engineering.
It's purpose is to progresively automate the most common (and often boring) tasks of conventional ML workflows.
Tasks such as data preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, model selection, hyperparameter tunning, model validation, deployment, and monitoring.
Despite its novelty, AutoML has become prominent in the last few years, as more profesionals from every field get into machine learning, often without a solid background in machine learning and no time to learn all the necessary theory.

The following is a beginner-friendly introduction to the AutoML field.
Our purpose is not to survey all the deep theory behind AutoML, but rather to provide an entry-point for newcommers, interested both in the research aspects and the practical aspects of AutoML.
To narrow our focus, we decided to analize a set of practical AutoML systems, and extend outwards into the underlying theory guided by the paradigms and concepts that are most commonly used in these practical scenarios.

We provide follow-up references on many of the topics we cover.
